                        Hello, I'm Diego Rabelo, a web developer with a few years of experience.
                        Currently I work on creating apis using MySQL, PostgresSQL or MongoDB as a database and Express or Nestjs as frameworks for development.
                    </p>

                            In the past I have worked as a BI analyst using tools such as Qliview and QlikSense.
                            I also have experience in creating web systems as a PHP developer. I'm currently studying Nextjs, microservices and clean architecture to improve myself as a professional.
